Often, refugees are portrayed in the media as pitiful, lying on the ground, starving, and having a depressed stare. This project aims to change that negative imagery. By donating cups, you contribute to expanding our perception of refugees. In our homes, we have many unwanted cups â€” perhaps they do not match our interior, or they were gifts we did not like. Like these cups, refugees are often treated as unwanted. This project transforms these cups from disposable objects into something valued and wanted. As more cups are gathered, it's a sign that more individuals are reevaluating their perspectives and choosing empathy and inclusion over indifference. Your thoughtful participation is essential for this initiative. With each cup donated, we take a step closer to dismantling the stereotypes that have been built over time and replacing them with a more compassionate and inclusive narrative. Your support is not just about cups; it's about reshaping our shared understanding of what it means to be a refugee and fostering a society that welcomes and values their presence. Together, we can amplify the message that refugees are not pitiable, but resilient; not disposable, but valuable members of our community.</p>
